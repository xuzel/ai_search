## Progress Summary

All six core project requirements and four additional features have been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. The system achieves 100% completion of the announced specifications, with all components reaching production-ready status. The implementation demonstrates comprehensive coverage across intelligent routing, retrieval-augmented generation, advanced ranking mechanisms, workflow orchestration, multimodal processing, and domain-specific intelligence. Beyond the core requirements, the project delivers a complete web interface, secure code execution environment, persistent dialogue management, and extensive test coverage spanning 173 test functions across 11 test files. The system architecture exhibits strong modularity with low coupling between components, facilitating future maintenance and extension. Technical implementation adheres to production standards including async-first design, multi-provider redundancy, comprehensive error handling, and security isolation mechanisms.
